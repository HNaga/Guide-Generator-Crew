  "introduction": "Welcome to CrewAI 101! This guide is your gentle introduction to the exciting world of autonomous AI agents and how the CrewAI framework empowers you to build and orchestrate them. We'll explore what AI agents are, why collaborative multi-agent systems are powerful, and how CrewAI simplifies their creation. No prior AI agent experience is needed, and we assume your Python and CrewAI development environment is already set up.",
  "target_audience": "Individuals new to AI development, students exploring AI concepts, hobbyists curious about AI agents, and Python users with no prior CrewAI experience (who have completed \"Setting Up Your CrewAI Development Environment\" or have an existing Python setup ready for CrewAI).",
